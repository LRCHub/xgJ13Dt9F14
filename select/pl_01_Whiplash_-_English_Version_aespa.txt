One look, give 'em whiplash
Beat drop with a big flash
Coming hot, better think fast
This look is a must have, uh
When you see it,

Day one, know I been bad, uh
Don't stop, better press gas
Going Hammer, can't touch that

Under pressure, body sweating,
can you focus? (Yeah)

Just close your eyes,
breathe in and visualize
One look, give 'em whiplash
Beat drop with a big flash
Coming hot, better think fast
This look is a must have, uh

Going Hammer, can't touch that
